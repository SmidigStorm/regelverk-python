Policy Pattern - Complex business decisions.

Policies encapsulate complex business rules and decision-making logic
that doesn't naturally belong to a single entity or value object.

Example usage:
    quota_policy = QuotaAssignmentPolicy()
    assigned_quota = quota_policy.assign_quota(student, program)

    priority_policy = AdmissionPriorityPolicy()
    priority_order = priority_policy.determine_priority(applicants)
